instagram_app

This app develops a simple Instagram-like web application where users can upload images and corresponding text. The tutorial can be found at the following URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpFO4Zr0EPE. 

This was built on Ruby 5.0.0 and Rails 2.4.0.

The application currently features a few functionalities as described below. 

A "new post" functionality, where you can upload an image and write corresponding text.

It also features a "register" function, so users can create personal accounts to use the site.
